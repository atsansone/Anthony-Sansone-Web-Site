HTML5 Refactoring
=================

This was fairly straightforward until I ran into a few problems with how CSS3 handled certain components. I needed to make sure to declare header, footer, nav and section as display:block to work everywhere. 

CCS3
====

Outside of the HTML5 issues, I ended up simplifying the CSS because there were fewer selectors. I did change some things, like changing to multi-column layout on the front to simplify things for me. I may go back to floats, but I just wanted this part finished.

PHP
===

The biggest change was refactoring into PHP so I could simplify the menus and repetitive components. These are all now handled with more grace and speed I think.

On the table
============

I am looking to change "Contacts" to "Pursuits" and merge more from the various social sites I frequent into one page. I have already gotten the API Keys for LinkedIn, Twitter, GoodReads and Steam as well as the components for other sites. I ran out of time to figure out how to implement the various OAuth, JSON and XML bits, but hope to do that over break.
