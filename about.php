      <p>I am a native of <a href="http://www.visitmilwaukee.org" title="Find out more about the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com" title="Find out more about the State of Wisconsin.">Wisconsin</a> and have lived in <a href="http://www.oak-park.us" title="Find out more about the Village of Oak Park.">Oak Park</a>, <a href="http://www.enjoyillinois.com"  title="Find out more about the State of Illinois.">Illinois</a> since 2001.</p>
      <p>My Bachelors degree in <a href="http://www.polisci.wisc.edu" title="Learn about the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin.">Political Science</a> was received from the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu" title="Learn about the University of Wisconsin. Go Badgers!">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in 1994. I have worked in corporate communications and systems groups in <a href="http://www.nielsen.com" title="I worked here from 1997 to 2005 in global communications and systems.">large</a> <a href="http://www.emc.com" title="I have worked here since 2007.">multinationals</a> and <a href="http://www.agentrics.com" title="I worked here from 2005 to 2007.">small startups</a> and in <a href="http://www.channel3000.com" title="I worked here from 1995 to 1997.">television stations</a> doing web development, technical training, technical writing and application support. </p>
      <p>Many consider me hopelessly overextended for pursuing a <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/programs/grad/tcid.shtml" title="I am completing a degree in Technical Communication">Masters degree</a> at the <a href="http://www.iit.edu" title="I really dig IIT">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> while serving as an officer in two <a href="http://www.gcfa.com" title="I have been the secretary for this association since 2009">non-profit</a> <a href="http://www.dailycardinal.net" title="I founded and have served as president of this association since 1997">organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.emc.com" title="Again, same company listed above; I love working here">working full time</a>. My hope is that this degree advances my knowledge of how to best communicate ideas, concepts, processes and systems.</p>
